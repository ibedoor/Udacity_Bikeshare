***Bike Share Data***

In this project, I used data provided by **Motivate**, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, 
to uncover bike share usage patterns. You will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

\**The Datasets**\
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

1. Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
2. End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
3. Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
4. Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
5. End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
6. User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

In this project, I provided the following information:

**#1 Popular times of travel**
- most common month
- most common day of week
- most common hour of day

**#2 Popular stations and trip**
- most common start station
- most common end station
- most common trip from start to end

**#3 Trip duration**
- total travel time
- average travel time

**#4 User info**
- counts of each user type
- counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
- earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
